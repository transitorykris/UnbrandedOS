# UnbrandedOS

UnbrandedOS is the beginnings of a little pre-emptive multitasking kernel for the MC68010 on a [Rosco-m68k](https://rosco-m68k.com/).
Unbranded because it doesn't have a real name yet ;)

## Rosco code

Note: for convenience this currently contains a pretty sloppy fork of [Rosco's firmware and standard library]([Rosco standard libraries](https://github.com/rosco-m68k/rosco_m68k/tree/develop/code/software/libs)).
